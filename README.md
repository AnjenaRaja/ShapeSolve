# ShapeSolve

Hello, I am Anjena. 

I will develop a program called ShapeSolve that would solve geometry problems for my project.

I have always liked math and computer programming so this project will help me learn Python programming and help students learn math.
I will need a computer, Python’s development environment called IDLE and books. I might also need a thumb drive to backup my work.
I have not programmed using Python before, so I plan to prepare all design work using Flowcharts first as it can help overcome this risk. I also intend to learn Python programming during weekends to gain familiarity.

I strongly believe ShapeSolver will help students and I plan to make it open source. College entrance exams such as SAT and ACT test students on area and perimeter problems. ShapeSolver will be an invaluable tool to quiz students for their test preparations. 

Thank you for your time and attention.

Python – Programming language such as C or JAVA

IDLE – Integrated DeveLopment Environment

Flowchart – A diagram that represents the software workflow

Open Source – Source code of the software is made available free for all, to learn and improve

SAT – Scholastic Aptitude/Assessment Test

ACT – American College Test
